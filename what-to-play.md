<h2 align="center">What to Play?</h2>

The purpose of playing ought to be extraction of satisfaction withouht feeling the guilt of whiling away time. To that end, repititive or boring gameplay should be automated, gameplay with the best rewards should be focused on and the whole game should be thoroughly understood.

### Automating Great Guild War

For fortress enhancement during GGW, let the game run missions (preferably Shinobi Cultivation or Roundup) by itself using an autoclicker and auto mode, thereby milking lots of tactician's scrolls. Once the count of tactician's scrolls reaches 20k, enhance the guild fortress.

Remember to attack five enemy guild fortresses during an attack period.

### Automating Team Attack Missions

Use auto mode to defeat bots and rare fortresses in TAM.

### Automating Roundup Missions

Use autoclicker in combination with auto mode.

### Automating Special Attack Mission

Getting a rank within top 5k is very much doable even with a non-boosted unit. Get lots of tickets from the Exchange Shop and search for LVL 16 Mirage Boses. With an autolicker and help from other players, they can be easily cleared.

### Automating Time-Limited Events

Time-Limited missions are automated in the same way Roundup is automated.
