### Style of Play

**AM** (short for *Attack Missions*) is standard PvP in NxB NV. Choosing a *main* shinobi for AM is one pivotal step to dominating in AM. I prefer solo main (going AM alone) to team main (going AM with supports). I am very selective about (solo) main but once chosen, I usually stick with it for a long while. In general, an AM main should last at least 5-6 months. Anniversaries are a good time to switch main as they often come with OP shinobi. I only choose among Attack type, Skill type or Utility type (in this order) for main. I prefer post-War Sasuke, Itachi (Anbu or Reanimation) and Naruto.

**AOM** (short for *All-Out Missions*) require strong shinobi of each type. I keep a list of shinobi tailor-made for AOM. Ideally, they have either (1) UJ LVL 8 (plus LB if applicable) with a maxed viable kit or (2) EX with 40k+ ATK stats.

**SAM** (short for *Special Attack Mission*) is the most time-intensive and repititive aspect of the game and as such, it is complemented immensely by an auto clicker. Completing a ton of LVL 16 Mirage Boses with the help of other players usually puts me in top 5k with a non-boosted shinobi.

**Time-Limited Events** are a good way to advance through the game for they often offer synthesize materials, ability points, tools, summon tickets and even shinobites. Just logging in and completing them is a daily routine.

**Summons** are almost the only way to get hands on shinobi cards (apart from SAM, of course). In general, I summon only during anniversaries or when there is a very compelling first-time discount. There can be an exception to this &mdash; if there is a new favorite shinobi with good kit during non-anniversary, I summon it especially if I have enough shinobites for a guaranteed EX card or LB card.
