** AoM: Collection

These are shinobi well optimized for All-Out Missions (AoM). Shinobi names are written in short forms. "Reanimation" is reduced to "Edo", "Illusionary World Outfit" to "Wizard" and "The Final Showdown" to "FV". Certain names are abbreviated. Their ultimate info or additional information is given after the colon after their names.
